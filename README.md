monstercraft
============
This is the github for the minecraft mod MonsterCraft, based on the EDM music label [Monstercat](http://www.monstercat.com/). Not much can be said, as I have not brought attention to monstercat and will be doing so in future times.

Installation
------------
You install this mod like Hackery, or any other ForgeGradle mod. Here's what to do:
  1. Clone the repository (or just download the .zip and extract it to a folder)
  2. Open your command line, navigate to the folder, and run `gradlew clean setupCIWorkspace build`
  3. you'll find the .jar in `build\libs`

To-Do list
------------
  - Boss "The Munsta"
  - Tamable Artist mods
  - Music disks with releases (ask for permission)
  - Weapons with song names (razor sharp) and make them upgradable (new style)
Dependencies
------------
No dependencies needed. Not tested with other mods.
